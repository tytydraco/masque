# Privacy Policy

Masque uses Google Firestore as the database to store messages sent from the app. Messages are stored in **plain text**, along with the display name used to send the message. A UNIX timestamp is also used to display the time and date that a message was sent.

## Data collected

The only data being collected and sent to the backend database is:

* The display name set in the app
* The contents of the message sent
* The UNIX timestamp (in milliseconds) of the message sent

## Privacy

This data is not encrypted in the database. The developer will not provide any stored data unless requested by law enforcement.

## Responsibility

It is not the obligation of the developer to sanitize, delete, retrieve, or manipulate any data that belongs to Masque.
